# CAR PRICE ANALYSIS
This is a statistical model problem aiming to leverage advanced analytical techniques to uncover the intricate relationships between car features and prices. By employing regression analysis and market segmentation, the goal is to provide consumers with accurate predictions and personalized recommendations tailored to their preferences and budget constraints. Through a comprehensive exploration of the automotive landscape, the project seeks to empower car buyers, dealerships, and industry stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making
### Overview
this project aims to develop a sophisticated car price analysis system. By amalgamating diverse attributes such as car specifications, market trends, and demographic insights, the system endeavors to offer users a tailored and informed car purchasing experience. The dataset's extensive coverage enables a nuanced exploration of factors influencing car prices, including both explicit features and implicit market dynamics. Through meticulous analysis of user demographics and preferences, the system seeks to cater to a wide range of car buyers, ensuring inclusivity and relevance in its recommendations.
### Business Understanding
Here the primary challenge extends beyond mere price prediction; it revolves around delivering a comprehensive and tailored car purchasing experience for consumers. Navigating through the vast array of available vehicles presents a significant obstacle, as buyers are confronted with the daunting task of evaluating numerous factors such as brand reputation, model specifications, and market trends to find the ideal car. This project aims to serve as a guiding beacon in this automotive landscape, introducing a sophisticated car price analysis system meticulously crafted around extensive datasets.The ultimate goal is not just to predict car prices but to revolutionize the consumer's interaction with the car-buying process. The essence of the challenge lies in unraveling individual preferences, and this project seeks to unravel this complexity through an advanced analytical framework.

1. Data Wrangling/analysis/understanding
 Here we will work on data cleaning, handle missing values, transform our data, handle duplicates, reshape the data for modelling and other processes to esnure that we have a clean, structured, and suitable format for analysis and modelling processes.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Here we will explore the different features of the dataset to gain better understanding of the data. we will use data vizualization tools to uncover the trends and patterns in our dataset. we will use Feature engineering to create new features from existing ones required for analysis.

2.1 Univariate Analysis.
Analysis of one variable  at a time to understand the relationship between that feature

2.2 Bivariate Analysis
Analysis of two variables  at a time to understand their relationship with the target

3. Modelling
Here we are building machine learning models that are good in recognizing patterns and have high prediction power
4. Evaluation
Metrics such as rmse and mae are used to evaluate and pick the best model
